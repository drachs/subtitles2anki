blur
"In Japanese, ボケ can refer to 'blur' or 'fuzziness.' It is often used in photography to describe the out-of-focus parts of an image, typically producing a pleasing aesthetic effect. Additionally, it can mean senility or mental fade, commonly used to describe symptoms of dementia, or even as a term for a comedic 'fool' in manzai acts."
