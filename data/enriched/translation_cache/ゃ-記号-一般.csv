"The character 'ゃ' is a small hiragana symbol used in Japanese. It often appears as part of a digraph such as 'きゃ (kya)', changing the pronunciation of certain kana to represent sounds that do not exist in standalone forms. For instance, it modifies 'き (ki)' to 'きゃ (kya)'. It does not have a direct English translation and typically serves a phonetic role in the Japanese writing system."
