Mr./Ms./Mrs.
"The term '様' (sama) is a polite honorific suffix used in Japanese to address or refer to someone with respect, similar to 'Mr.', 'Ms.', or 'Mrs.' in English. It shows a higher level of respect than the more common 'さん' (san) and is often used in formal situations, when addressing customers (as in 'お客様' - 'okyakusama', meaning 'customer'), or referring to deities and important figures."
