anyway
"In a more detailed sense, 'どうせ' is used to express a feeling of resignation or indifference, suggesting something is inevitable or doesn't matter. It can mean 'in any case', 'after all', or 'at any rate'. It is often used in a context where the speaker is acknowledging a situation they believe will not change, or where they feel helpless or dismissive."
