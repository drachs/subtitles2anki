"The term 'よ' often conveys a sense of assurance, encouragement, or emphasis when added to the end of sentences or adjectives in Japanese. It is not a standalone adjective but is used in conjunction with other words to alter or stress their meaning, offering a friendly or forceful tone, like when affirming, confirming or softening."
