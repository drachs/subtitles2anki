want
"The term 'ほしかっ' is derived from '欲しい' (hoshii), meaning 'want' or 'desirable'. It is used to express a wish or desire for something. This form is often preceded by particles to indicate what is being desired. As an adjective and not independently functional, it requires a subject, such as a noun, to be complete."
