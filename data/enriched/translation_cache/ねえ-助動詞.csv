isn't it
"The word 'ねえ' in Japanese is used as an auxiliary verb to express agreement, seeking confirmation, or implying a suggestion. It is often appended to sentences to invite the listener to agree or to share the speaker’s thought or feeling. It is similar to saying 'isn't it,' 'right,' or 'don't you think' in English."
