べ
"There is no direct translation for 'べ' into English, as it is a colloquial or dialectal particle in Japanese, often used for emphasis, to express intention, or to indicate a decision. In various dialects in Japan, especially in regions like Tohoku or Kansai, it can be used similarly to saying 'let's' or 'shall we.'"
